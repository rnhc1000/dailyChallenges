/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 * In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. 
 * There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 * The town judge trusts nobody.
 * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing 
 * that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. 
 * If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or 
 * return -1 otherwise.
